\subsection{Network Channels}

Channels in Contiki are virtual \cite{tel-aviv-contiki-exercises}. This means that when a connection is opened if you do not want to receive packets from another connection then a different channel should be used. It does not mean that different radio frequencies are used. To use different radio frequencies the function \verb|cc2420_set_channel| should be used to change the frequency messages are broadcasted on.
