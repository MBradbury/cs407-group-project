\section{Introduction}

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly prevalent due to decreasing hardware costs and hardware size \cite{TankBible}. Therefore, it is important that we consider issues with them now, so we are prepared for when they become widely used. A major issue with any system is that it may contain bugs, fortunately, there are many well known methodologies for detecting and eliminating bugs \cite{1382572, 749477, ?}. However, in distributed systems there are additional challenges to overcome \cite{5010224} and there are additional challenges to overcome with WSNs due to the energy constrained environment they work in \cite{?}.
