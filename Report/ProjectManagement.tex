\section{Project Management}

\subsection{Methodology}
% Just notes...

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initially we were given by our supervisor a list of different topics on how we can investigate the problems associated with wireless sensor networks such as global prodicate detection, netowork debugging and energy analysis.
	\item Since WSN is a rapidly growing area of research and developement with a wide range of applications, our team spent some weeks researching on (1) the ideal plateform to develop and simulate our network, (2) different routing, clustering and communication protocols for WSN, (3) areas of research to investigate. A breakdown of the research areas and schedule is shown in section 9.3.
	\item Team leader was elected to lead the project: Matthew Bradbury
	\item Research was an ongoing process and we had some indication as what is to be implemented
	\item Team members were formed in groups to start developing different components of the network (independently)
	\item Initially all code was tested on the simulation.
	\item We started familiarising ourselves with the real sensors by running them with dummy code.
	\item By the end of the first term, most of the algorithms were implemented and tested independently.
	\item In the second term, most of the time was spent integrating the components together and optimizing the algorithms
	\item Our main focus of the project was evaluating predictes over the network and that was tested on the simulator for simplicity
	\item Testing the system on the nodes and recording results
\end{enumerate}

Due to a large number of concepts to investigate and deciding on the most optimum algorithm to implement, our project was subject to alot of changes. As a result we followed a spiral evolutionary process model which allowed for accomodation of these changes throught the development.

\subsection{Delivery plan (Gantt Chart)}

\subsection{Risk Analysis}
%Potentially the issues below can form part of risk

\subsection{Resources}
% Can explain more on the software we used to share resources, communicate and discuss ideas.

\subsubsection{Working Concurrently}

We signed up for a Git repository on BitBucket \cite{bitbucket} where we plan to commit all the work we produce. We initially had an issue that free private repositories hosted on BitBucket have a maximum of 5 participants, whereas we had 6 group members. Fortunately when new users sign up to the services from an invite, the person that sends the invite gets additional capacity. This meant that the person who created the repository ended up with enough capacity for all members to access the account.

\subsection{Management Issues}

\subsubsection{Group Members Without Internet}
Unfortunately two of our group members were without internet for the first 3 weeks of term. This was an issue because they were unable to just work in the DCS labs because the computers there didn't have the software required (such as VirtualBox or the WSN simulators). To work around this, those two members were given tasks that could be accomplished with their own machines and without internet. Once they obtained internet they were given tasks, that access allowed them to accomplish.

\subsubsection{Society Exec Clashes}
Two members of our team are on the exec of Warwick Societies, this means that at certain parts of the year they were in high demand for those jobs. For instance during the first few weeks of term during Freshers' Fortnight, the exec members were required to be involved in many of their events that they were running. However, after these first weeks the demand on their time decreased and made balancing the time been the demands of this project and their exec roles much easier.

\subsection{Legal, social, ethical and professional issues}
