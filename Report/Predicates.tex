\subsection{Predicate Scripting Language}

\subsubsection{Required Features}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Numerical support (Integer and Floating point) ($+$ $-$ $\times$ $/$ $=$ $\neq$ $<$ $\leq$ $>$ $\geq$)
	\item Set support (Creation and operating on) ($\cup$ $\cap$ $\setminus$ $\{\}$ $\forall$ $\exists$)

	\item Ability to specify predicate target(s) (Single node, multiple nodes or entire network)
	\item Ability to get the current node ($this$)
	\item Ability to get sensor information on a node (temperature, humidity, \ldots)
	\item Ability to get node information (Distance to Sink, \ldots)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Non-Required Features}

There are lots of features that are usually provided by scripting languages that would cause undesirable effects such as inflating the binary size.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Strings
	\item Complicated data structures (Lists, Arrays, Dictionaries, \ldots)
	\item Library features (Custom libraries or built-in libraries)
	\item Interactive mode (terminals)
	\item IO
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Evaluation Methods}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Send scripting language to node, they interpret and evaluate it
	\item Compile predicate on base station, compress and send to node(s) for evaluation
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Where to Evaluate Predicates}

Given the problem of assigning slots in a TDMA MAC protocol, one would wish to ensure that no node within two hops of any given node has the same slot. This raises a question of where this predicate should be evaluated to ensure minimum energy usage in its evaluation.

The first predicate we might consider is the one where for ever node, we get the 2-hop neighbourhood and check that none of those nodes have the same slot as the initial node. This means that we would need to send:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A message from the base station to the node asking it to evaluate the predicate
	\item A message from the node to each of its 2-hop neighbours
	\item Each 2-hop neighbour needs to send a message back to the node
	\item The node would need to wait for its neighbours to send the messages, then evaluate the predicate. This would imply that the node would need to know who is in its two hop neighbourhood
	\item The node would need to report to the base station the result of the predicate
\end{enumerate}

So we would need at best $2\Delta_{sink} + 2|Neighbours(n, 2)|$ messages to evaluate this predicate for one node.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:2-hop-slot-pred}
& \hspace{3em}	\forall n \in Nodes \cdot \\
& \hspace{6em}		\forall n' \in Neighbours(n, 2) \cdot \\
& \hspace{9em}			(n.slot \neq n'.slot)
\end{align}

The second predicate we could consider is the one where every node checks their 1-hop neighbourhood for slot collisions. Here we model the 2-hop nature of the predicate differently, because instead of checking on the node that we want to check for slot collisions, we check on the node between two nodes that might have slot collisions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A message from the base station to the node adjacent to that we asking to check slot collisions
	\item A message from the node to each of its 1-hop neighbours
	\item Each 1-hop neighbour needs to send a message back to the node
	\item The node would need to wait for its neighbours to send the messages, then evaluate the predicate. This would imply that the node would need to know who is in its two hop neighbourhood
	\item The node would need to report to the base station the result of the predicate
\end{enumerate}

So we would need at best $2(\Delta_{sink} + 1) + 2|Neighbours(n, 1)|$ messages to evaluate this predicate for one node.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:1-hop-slot-pred}
&				\forall n \in Nodes \cdot \\
& \hspace{3em}		\forall n' \in Neighbours(n, 1) \cup \{n\} \cdot \\
& \hspace{6em}			\forall n'' \in Neighbours(n, 1) \cup \{n\} \cdot \\
& \hspace{9em}				(n' \not= n'' \implies n'.slot \neq n''.slot)
\end{align}

Overall we can assume that $|Neighbours(1, n)| \leq |Neighbours(2, n)|$, so checking 1-hop neighbours would in general require fewer message. Also we can assume that when checking these predicates, we would make sure that every node is checked (as the predicates are defined). This means that the first predicate would duplicate the checks: checking node $n$ for a collision with $n'$ and when $n'$ is asked to check the predicate it will query $n$.

However, if we were not asking the entire network to check for this property, then the first predicate would behave better. This is because the second predicate would have to be called for every 1-hop neighbour of the intended node. However, as it is assumed that the entire network would be asked if this predicate holds, then the second predicate is better.


\subsubsection{Getting and Waiting for Neighbourhood Data}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If all neighbours are known then 1-hop predicates can wait for each node to send data. This has extra memory and communication requirements
	\item If we do not know who our n-hop neighbours are then we can just set a time out to wait for results
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If we do not receive all items what should be done?
		\item Should we report that the predicate is true, even though we didn't receive all the information?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item What data should be sent from surrounding nodes and how could we access it?
\end{enumerate}


When asking for information on the neighbourhood, it possible to consider optimisations due to the structure of the predicate. For example take conjunctive predicates where the structure of the predicate $P$ is $P = P_1 \land P_2 \land \ldots \land P_n$. If one of the $P_i$ is false then the result of the predicate $P$ is false ($False \land P \Leftrightarrow False$). This means that the statements could potentially be evaluated in an order such that the $P_i$ that requires the fewest resources is evaluated first and the $P_j$ that requires the most resources is evaluated last.

The aim of this optimisation is to reduce energy usage by sending fewer messages. For the two types of data gathering in-network and at the sink, when gathering this data at the sink it would not be of any use as the data is sent to the sink in an event-based or periodic way. The sink doesn't ask for this information, so it is not possible for it to not ask for certain pieces of data. This is also true of event-based in-network predicate checking. So the only time this optimisation would be of use to us is when gathering data for in-network predicates that are checked periodically.

Surprisingly, asking for and receiving all the required information actually requires fewer messages than incrementally asking for information. This is because of the communication that needs to be repeated when asking for more information. For example if you have a conjunctive predicate where the sub-predicates require 1 and 3 hops of information. If we ask for all information then we simply send messages out 3 hops and then receive replies from all the nodes in that neighbourhood. If we instead ask for one-hop information first and then three-hop, we first have to send a message to local neighbours and then will end up sending them another data request message when asking for three-hop information (as the 1-hop neighbourhood is contained within the 3-hop neighbourhood).

For some predicates it may make obvious sense, such as if there is a conjunctive predicate that needs 1-hop information and 15-hop information. If the 1-hop predicate is often false, then it saves asking for information from all nodes that are within 15 hops of the evaluating node. However, as many of the predicates are not likely to require information from that distance (we expect one to two hops, with the possibility of three hops) it is an optimisation that would end up degrading the performance of requesting the near-by information. Also adding this feature would increase the firmware size, which began to reach the limit when the predicate evaluation libraries that aggregate data to the sink were implemented.

The sigma function is defined as it is because for each of the nodes that are $x$ hops away they will require sending their data message $x$ hops to reach the requesting node.

\subsection{Implementing Primitives}

There are certain primitives that we are going to need to implement. One of these is the $Neighbours(n, h)$ primitive, that takes a parameter $n$ that is the node we wish to get neighbour information on and $d$ which is the distance in hops from the node $n$ that we will ask for information.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hcluster-neighbours-predicate}
& \hspace{3em}	\forall n \in Nodes \cdot \\
& \hspace{6em}		\exists n' \in Neighbours(n, H) \cdot \\
& \hspace{9em}			IsClusterHead(n)
\end{align}

An example of a predicate that uses $Neighbours(n, h)$ is shown above. This predicate is for Hierarchical Clustering where $H$ is a parameter that defines the distance between cluster heads. The predicate checks that for every node there is a neighbour in the $H$-hop neighbourhood that is a cluster head.

An alternative way that we might specify this predicate is to check that the distance between a node and the cluster head (that it knows the address of) is within $H$ hops.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hcluster-distance-predicate}
& \hspace{3em}	\forall n \in Nodes \cdot \\
& \hspace{6em}		IsSink(n) \lor Distance(n, ClusterHead(n)) \leq H
\end{align}

However, there is an issue with this predicate. How would we implement the $Distance(n, n')$ primitive? With $Neighbours(n, h)$ we know how far we need to ask for information ($h$ hops), with $Distance(n, n')$ the maximum distance that we will need to wait for information to return from is the diameter of the network. Unfortunately we cannot assume that the diameter is known. If instead we take a time-out approach there is no way that we can guarantee to wait for the correct amount of time. For example if we wait enough time to check if a node is at maximum $D$ hops from the given node the node will need to wait for $2 \times D \times T_{send}$ time units. However, if the node we are trying to find the distance of is at $D + 1 $ hops then we will not believe the two nodes are connected. To reliably wait to check if two nodes are connected in a network where the diameter is not known we will need to wait for $\infty$ time units. Thus making $Distance(n, n')$ impossible to implement without knowing the diameter.

\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Bytecode}

One of the most important aims of the predicate language's bytecode was to be as small as possible. The reason for this was to support sending as much program information in the limited length of a network packet. To achieve this aim it meant that we needed to make the virtual machine handle more abstract representations of its components. For example, initially the bytecode for calling a function contained a byte for the opcode of \verb|CALL| and then a string of characters which contained the name of the function to call. At minimum this would cost 2 bytes - one for the character of the function's name and one for the NUL character. To improve this the string was replaced with a single byte, which means that the number of functions callable by the virtual machine ends up being limited to 256. The same was true for the variable ids as well and as the variable id is contained with an unsigned byte, they to are limited to 256.


When developing the virtual machine what also became important was the fact that the bytecode was a string of unsigned bytes, where sequences of them could end up representing a 16 bit integer or a 32 bit float. This is important because it could mean that we would try to perform unaligned reads which the CPU of our motes could potentially get wrong\footnote{\url{http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.contiki.devel/1462}}, this is due to the restrictions the CPU has on the alignment of words ``Bytes are located at even or odd addresses. Words are only located at even addresses \ldots. When using word instructions, only even addresses may be used. The low byte of a word is always an even address'' \cite[Section~1.4.5 (p.~28)]{msp430usersguide}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Diagrams/byte-alignment.eps}
\caption{Alignment Issues}
\label{fig:alignment-issues}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\caption{Example of the error messages produced by MSPSim in Cooja that led to the discovery of this bug}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:alignment-issues} if we were to align the words as the CPU wanted the size of the bytecode would massively increase as every single byte bytecode would need to be padded by a byte to (i) make sure all bytecode entries were the same length and to ensure the word parameters are correctly aligned. To solve this issue instead of accessing the memory directly in the bytecode what can be done instead is to copy the memory out byte-by-byte into a correctly aligned block of memory and use that instead.

\subsection{Testing}

As the virtual machine and its parsers can be fairly complex and difficult pieces of code to understand it was very important that we had test cases that validated that the functionality was correct. To do this three sets of tests are performed. Of them two are unit tests, one that tests that assembled bytecode can be correctly executed and the other that tests that the parser can correctly parse and generate code. After this is an integration test, that checks if the output of the parser/compiler converted into bytecode by the assembler can be correctly executed. To test the correct execution set data is given to the virtual machine, which can then be used in the predicates.

Different things are tested for each of the integration tests. When testing the assembler and virtual machine, short programs of opcodes are provided to test simple activities such as pushing onto the stack, calling functions or arithmetic. This is simply to test the functionality of the virtual machine. As we can be sure that the functionality is correct, when testing the compiler more complex predicates that we have designed the system to use are tested. We expect that for some of these tests scripts the code would be the same for real world uses.
