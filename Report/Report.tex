\begin{abstract}
Debugging tools are vital for developers to produce reliable software, however traditional tools are less useful when developing software for new system paradigms such as wireless sensor networks. As wireless sensor networks (WSNs) become increasing prevalent in our lives it will become ever more important that the software they are running works reliably and to do this debugging tools will be required. This project investigates how predicates can be specified and checked throughout WSNs and how errors can be reported to a base station. We also investigate deploying these applications not just in a simulator but on hardware in an environment where unexpected failures may occur.

\section{Required Tools}

A simulator and operating system needs to be chosen that will allow us to test our code locally, then provide functionality to deploy that code to the network easily. We will now provide a comparison between the two primary operating systems, Contiki \cite{23839452} and TinyOS \cite{levis2003tossim}, and their respective simulators with a view to deciding which system best suits this projects goals and motivations.

TinyOS and it's simulator TOSSIM were originally created at UC Berkeley as part of the DARPA NEST Program. TinyOS is a static system where designers must allocate resources during design-time. TinyOS is also a monolithic system, in this system programs are compiled with the OS code and distributed to network nodes together as one image.

Contiki was developed by Adam Dunkels and is an open source operating system designed for the Internet of Things. Contiki is a dynamic system that allows resources to be allocated and deallocated at run-time. Contiki is a modular system where programs are compiled into an individual module that can be distributed to the network nodes which run the code dynamically.

Both systems are event driven, however Contiki also offers native multi-threading support through proto-threads where as TinyOS does not and requires a library to gain access to threading through TinyThreads \cite{?}. TinyOS programs are implemented in nesC a variation of C designed for the TinyOS platform. The simulator COOJA can run both C and Java code but the Contiki OS can only run C code. Both systems use custom wireless networking stacks that are optimised for low power consumption. In a comparison of energy and time efficiency between Contiki and TinyOS \cite{?} it is shown that the differences between the two operating systems is negligible. The study found that Contiki is quicker at sensing, TinyOS is faster at communication between nodes and they are both equally efficient at processing tasks such as executing security algorithms.

We have chosen to use Contiki and COOJA for this project because it provides the most flexible system for developing applications that can quickly and easily be distributed to the network. Contiki also offers an easy to use fully functioning development environment and simulator tool all in one package. Finally, Contiki is almost as efficient as TinyOS in nearly every respect but provides all the additional features of a modular dynamic operating system and for these reasons this is why we have chosen it as the system we will develop for. 

\subsection{Risks with Hardware}

With the sensor nodes, we as a group have been given responsibility over them. This means we need to be very careful when transferring then between home and university. We must make sure that they are carried safely, packed away properly and protected from the environment when transferring (for example from rain).

\section{Knowledge Gained}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Not possible to write WSN applications in Java and have them run on the WSN nodes. Only possible to write in C and have that code run on the physical hardware. Java code will only run in the Cooja simulator for the Contiki OS.
	\item A Cooja plug-in that monitors and records network traffic would be specific only to the simulator and would not be possible to apply to physical nodes
	\item Always worth waiting for a period of time before starting protocol, to allow for nodes to set up
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Types of Predicates}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Checking sensor values are within an expected range
	\item Check that the network is not partitioned
	\item Check for node crashes
	\item Check for inconsistent state caused by lost messages
	\item Check that routing is optimal
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Shortest distance from source to sink
		\item No loops
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Logging Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Keep a short message send/received history. This could be combined with other node's knowledge as log is forwarded)
	\item Make logging reliable (TCP/IP?) even at the expense of energy
