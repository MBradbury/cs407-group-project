\subsection{Role Allocation}

We decided to allocate roles in the second week after we had the first week to perform research into the problem and find out what has been done. The following were how we assigned roles, although we intend for these to be flexible:

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
	Name & Role \\
	\hline
	Amit & ~ \\
	Dan & ~ \\
	Ivan & ~ \\
	Joe & ~ \\
	Matt & ~ \\
	Tim & ~ \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

	\multicolumn{7}{|l|}{\textbf{Term 1} - Developing for stationary networks} \\

\subsection{Working Concurrently}

We signed up for a Git repository on BitBucket \cite{?} where we plan to commit all the work we produce. We initially had an issue that free private repositories hosted on BitBucket have a maximum of 5 participants, whereas we had 6 group members. Fortunately when new users sign up to the services from an invite, the person that sends the invite gets additional capacity. This meant that the person who created the repository ended up with enough capacity for all members to access the account.

\subsection{Group Members Without Internet}
Unfortunately two of our group members were without internet for the first 3 weeks of term. This was an issue because they were unable to just work in the DCS labs because the computers there didn't have the software required (such as VirtualBox or the WSN simulators). To work around this, those two members were given tasks that could be accomplished with their own machines and without internet. Once they obtained internet they were given tasks, that access allowed them to accomplish.
