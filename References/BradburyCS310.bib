	specifically designed for sensor networks where energy awareness
	is an essential consideration. Most of the attention, however, has
	been given to the routing protocols since they might differ depending
	on the application and network architecture. This paper surveys recent
	routing protocols for sensor networks and presents a classification
	for the various approaches pursued. The three main categories explored
	in this paper are data-centric, hierarchical and location-based.
	Each routing protocol is described and discussed under the appropriate
	category. Moreover, protocols using contemporary methodologies such
	as network flow and quality of service modeling are also discussed.
	The paper concludes with open research issues.},

	loss is measured using information theory concepts; indeed, it is

	and average energy consumption the behavior of the routing protocol
	is modeled through a Markov chain in which states represent the nodes

	sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmental monitoring

	determining where a given node is physically located in a network,
	is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these
	applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form
	factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance
	on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques
	and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric
	method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of
	the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed
	number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions
	of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple
	connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries,
	to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes
	localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference
	points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation
	distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission
	range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show
	that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third
	of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend

  abstract = { A routing problem in static wireless ad hoc networks is considered
	as it arises in a rapidly deployed, sensor based, monitoring system
	known as the wireless sensor network. Information obtained by the
	monitoring nodes needs to be routed to a set of designated gateway
	nodes. In these networks, every node is capable of sensing, data
	processing, and communication, and operates on its limited amount
	of battery energy consumed mostly in transmission and reception at
	its radio transceiver. If we assume that the transmitter power level
	can be adjusted to use the minimum energy required to reach the intended
	next hop receiver then the energy consumption rate per unit information
	transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node, i.e., the
	routing decision. We formulate the routing problem as a linear programming
	problem, where the objective is to maximize the network lifetime,
	which is equivalent to the time until the network partition due to
	battery outage. Two different models are considered for the information-generation
	processes. One assumes constant rates and the other assumes an arbitrary
	process. A shortest cost path routing algorithm is proposed which
	uses link costs that reflect both the communication energy consumption
	rates and the residual energy levels at the two end nodes. The algorithm
	is amenable to distributed implementation. Simulation results with
	both information-generation process models show that the proposed
	algorithm can achieve network lifetime that is very close to the
	optimal network lifetime obtained by solving the linear programming

	issue that cannot be adequately addressed by network security is
	source-location privacy. Adversaries may use RF localization techniques
	to perform hop-by-hop traceback to the source sensor's location.
	This paper provides a formal model for the source-location privacy
	problem in sensor networks and examines the privacy characteristics
	of different sensor routing protocols. We examine two popular classes

	of routing protocols involving only a single path from the source

	protocols, we considered the tradeoffs between location-privacy and

	provide efficient source-location privacy while maintaining desirable
	system performance. In order to provide efficient and private sensor
	communications, we devised new techniques to enhance source-location
	privacy that augment these routing protocols. One of our strategies,
	a technique we have called phantom routing, has proven flexible and
	capable of protecting the source's location, while not incurring
	a noticeable increase in energy overhead. Further, we examined the
	effect of source mobility on location privacy. We showed that, even

	as it is often necessary to reprogram the sensors in place. In this
	paper, we propose a multihop reprogramming service designed for Mica-2/XSM
	motes. One of the problems in reprogramming is the issue of message
	collision. To reduce the problem of collision and hidden terminal
	problem, we propose a sender selection algorithm that attempts to
	guarantee that in a neighborhood there is at most one source transmitting
	the program at a time. Further, our sender selection is greedy in
	that it tries to select the sender that is expected to have the most
	impact. We also use pipelining to enable fast data propagation. MNP
	is energy efficient because it reduces the active radio time of a
	sensor node by putting the node into "sleep" state when its neighbors
	are transmitting a segment that is not of interest. Finally, we argue
	that it is possible to tune our service according to the remaining
	battery level of a sensor, i.e., it can be tuned so that the probability
	that a sensor is given the responsibility of transmitting the code
	is proportional to its remaining battery life},

	is proposed to make it difficult for an adversary to backtrack hop-by-hop
	to the origin of the sensor communication. In DROW, the source sensor
	sends out a packet, the packet is unicasted to its parent node. When
	intermediate node receives a packet, it forwards to one of its parent
	nodes in a directed random fashion. Compared to flooding-based phantom,
	DROW has smaller message latencies and lower energy costs. Especially,
	DROW has better safety period when intermediate node has multi-parent
	node.},
