  abstract = {This report introduces a new sensor network simulator for the Contiki
	OS - the COOJA Simulator. The Contiki OS is a portable operating
	system designed specifically for resource limited devices such as
	sensor nodes. It is built around an event-driven kernel but supports
	pre-emptive multithreading at a per-process basis. It also supports
	a full TCP/IP stack via uIP and the programming abstraction Protothreads.
	The main design goal of the COOJA Simulator is extendibility, for
	which Interfaces and Plugins are used. An Interface represents a
	sensor node property or device, such as a position, a button or a
	radio transmitter. A Plugin is used to interact with a simulation,
	for example to control the simulation speed or to watch all network
	traffic between the simulated nodes. Both new Plugins and Interfaces
	can easily be created and added to the simulation environment. A
	number of other parts of the simulator, for example a radio medium
	responsible for forwarding radio network data, can also be implemented
	and added to the simulator. And by supporting several different simulation
	environments at the same time in one simulation, different underlying
	hardware platforms can be simulated in heterogeneous networks. Java
	Native Interface is used to connect the new simulator with Contiki,
	allowing simulated applications to run in a real Contiki system.
	By using this approach, any simulated application can then be run
	on a real sensor node unaltered.},

	A global system predicate is defined as a conjunction of the local

	the scheduling of local event reporting across network elements for

	identifying the status of global parameters registered in the system.
	We design an optimal algorithm, the partition and rank (PAR) scheme,
	when the local events are independent; whereas, when they are dependent,
	we show that the problem is NP-complete and develop two efficient
	heuristics: the PAR for dependent events (PAR-D) and adaptive (Ada)

	However, low power and in-network data processing make data-centric
	routing in wireless sensor networks a challenging problem. In this
	paper we propose heuristics to construct and maintain an aggregation
	tree in sensor networks. This aggregation tree can be used to facilitate
	data-centric routing. The main idea is to turn off the radio of all
	leaf nodes to save power, and thereby extending the network lifetime.
	Therefore, in order to save the number of broadcasting messages,
	only the nonleaf nodes in the tree are in charge of data aggregation
	and traffic relaying. In this paper, we propose an efficient energy-aware
	distributed heuristic to generate the aggregation tree, which we
	refer to as EADAT. Our EADAT algorithm makes no assumption on local
	network topology, and is based on residual power. It makes use of
	neighboring broadcast scheduling and distributed competition among
	neighbors. These novel concepts make EADAT very efficient and effective,
	as demonstrated by our simulation experiments with NS2.},

	an interpreter for the language. To reduce program distribution energy
	the SCript interpreter stores a tokenized representation of the scripts

	footprint of the interpreter is similar to that of existing virtual

  abstract = {This thesis focuses on three fundamental issues that concern data
	aggregation protocols for periodic data collection in sensor networks:
	which sensor nodes should report their data, when should they report
	it, and should they use unicast or broadcast based protocols for
	this purpose. The issue of when nodes should report their data is
	considered in the context of real-time monitoring applications. The
	first part of this thesis shows that asynchronous aggregation, in
	which the time of each node’s transmission is determined adaptively
	based on its local history of past packet receptions from its children,
	outperforms synchronous aggregation by providing lower delay for
	a given end-to-end loss rate. Second, new broadcast-based aggregation
	protocols that minimize the number of packet transmissions, relying
	on multipath delivery rather than automatic repeat request for reliability,
	are designed and evaluated. The performance of broadcast-based aggregation
	is compared to that of unicast-based aggregation, in the context
	of both real-time and delay-tolerant data collection. Finally, this
	thesis investigates the potential benefits of dynamically, rather
	than semi-statically, determining the set of nodes reporting their
	data, in the context of applications in which coverage of some monitored
	region is to be maintained. Unicast and broadcast-based coverage-preserving
	data aggregation protocols are designed and evaluated. The performance
	of the proposed protocols is compared to that of data collection
	protocols relying on node scheduling.},

	detect even unstable predicates, without excessive overhead. In the
	past, such predicates have been regarded as too difficult to detect.
	The predicates are specified by using a logic described formally
	in this paper. We discuss detection of weak conjunctive predicates
	that are formed by conjunction of predicates local to processes in
	the system. Our detection methods will detect whether such a predicate
	is true for any interleaving of events in the system, regardless
	of whether the predicate is stable. Also, any predicate that can
	be reduced to a set of weak conjunctive predicates is detectable.
	This class of predicates captures many global predicates that are
	of interest to a programmer. The message complexity of our algorithm
	is bounded by the number of messages used by the program. The main

	the program. DIDUCE hypothesizes the strictest invariants at the
	beginning, and gradually relaxes the hypothesis as violations are
	detected to allow for new behavior. The violations reported help
	users to catch software bugs as soon as they occur. They also give
	programmers new visibility into the behavior of the programs such
	as identifying rare corner cases in the program logic or even locating
	hidden errors that corrupt the program's results. We implemented
	the DIDUCE system for Java programs and applied it to four programs
	of significant size and complexity. DIDUCE succeeded in identifying
	the root causes of programming errors in each of the programs quickly

	a timing-dependent bug in a released JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension)

	the sink as fast as possible. For such timeliness guarantees, TDMA-based
	scheduling can be used to assign time slots to nodes in which they
	can transmit messages. However, any slot assignment approach needs
	to be cognisant of the fact that crash failures can occur (e.g.,
	due to battery exhaustion, defective hardware). In this paper, we
	study the design of such data aggregation scheduling (converge cast)
	protocols. We make the following contributions: (i) we identify a

	two versions of the converge cast problem, namely (a) a strong version,

	cast cannot be solved in presence of crash failures, (v) we show

	cast in presence of crash failures, (vi) we provide a modular d-local
	algorithm that solves stabilising weak converge cast in presence
	of crash failures where d is the network radius, and (vii) we show
	how specific instantiations of parameters can lead to an d-local
	algorithm that achieves more efficient stabilization. Our contributions
	are novel: (i) the first contribution (necessary condition) provides
	the theoretical basis which explains the structure of existing converge

  abstract = {There has been a growing interest in applying formal methods for functional
	and performance verification of complex and safety critical designs.
	Model checking is one of the most common formal verification methodologies
	utilized in verifying sequential logic due to its automated decision
	procedures and its ability to provide ldquo;counter examples rdquo;
	for debugging. However, model checking hasn't found broad acceptance
	as a verification methodology due to its complexity. This arises
	because of the need to specify correctness properties in a temporal
	logic language and develop an environment around a partitioned model
	under test in a non deterministic HDL-type language. Generally, engineers
	are not trained in mathematical logic languages and becoming proficient
	in such a language requires a steep learning curve. Furthermore,
	defining a behavioral environment at the complex and undocumented
	microarchitectural interface level is a time consuming and error
	prone activity. As such, there is a strong motivation to bring the
	model checking technology to a level such that the designers may
	utilize this technology as a part of their design process without
	being burdened with the details that are generally only within the
	grasps of computer theoreticians. The paper outlines two tools which
	greatly assist in this goal: the first, Polly, automates the difficult
	and error prone task of developing the behavioral environment around
	the partitioned model under test; the second Oracle, obviates the
	need for learning temporal logic to enter specification},

  abstract = {Wireless platforms are becoming less expensive and more powerful,
	enabling the promise of widespread use for everything from health
	monitoring to military sensing. Like other networks, sensor networks
	are vulnerable to malicious attack. However, the hardware simplicity
	of these devices makes defense mechanisms designed for traditional
	networks infeasible. This paper explores the denial-of-sleep attack,
	in which a sensor node's power supply is targeted. Attacks of this
	type can reduce the sensor lifetime from years to days and have a
	devastating impact on a sensor network. This paper classifies sensor
	network denial-of-sleep attacks in terms of an attacker's knowledge
	of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol and ability to
	bypass authentication and encryption protocols. Attacks from each
	classification are then modeled to show the impacts on four sensor
	network MAC protocols, i.e., Sensor MAC (S-MAC), Timeout MAC (T-MAC),
	Berkeley MAC (B-MAC), and Gateway MAC (G-MAC). Implementations of
	selected attacks on S-MAC, T-MAC, and B-MAC are described and analyzed
	in detail to validate their effectiveness and analyze their efficiency.
	Our analysis shows that the most efficient attack on S-MAC can keep
	a cluster of nodes awake 100% of the time by an attacker that sleeps
	99% of the time. Attacks on T-MAC can keep victims awake 100% of
	the time while the attacker sleeps 92% of the time. A framework for
	preventing denial-of-sleep attacks in sensor networks is also introduced.
	With full protocol knowledge and an ability to penetrate link-layer
	encryption, all wireless sensor network MAC protocols are susceptible
	to a full domination attack, which reduces the network lifetime to
	the minimum possible by maximizing the power consumption of the nodes'
	radio subsystem. Even without the ability to penetrate encryption,
	subtle attacks can be launched, which reduce the network lifetime
	by orders of magnitude. If sensor networks are to meet current expectations,
	they mu- - st be robust in the face of network attacks to include
	denial-of-sleep.},

	medium access control (MAC) schemes in ad hoc, wireless networks.
	However, CSMA and its current variants do not provide quality-of-service
	(QoS) guarantees for real-time traffic support. This paper presents
	and studies black-burst (BB) contention, which is a distributed MAC
	scheme that provides QoS real-time access to ad hoc CSMA wireless
	networks. With this scheme, real-time nodes contend for access to
	the channel with pulses of energy-so called BBs-the durations of
	which are a function of the delay incurred by the nodes until the
	channel became idle. It is shown that real-time packets are not subject
	to collisions and that they have access priority over data packets.
	When operated in an ad hoc wireless LAN, BB contention further guarantees
	bounded and typically very small real-time delays. The performance
	of the network can approach that attained under ideal time division
	multiplexing (TDM) via a distributed algorithm that groups real-time
	packet transmissions into chains. A general analysis of BB contention
	is given, contemplating several modes of operation. The analysis
	provides conditions for the scheme to be stable. Its results are
