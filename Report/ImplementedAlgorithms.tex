\subsection{Container Library}

Contiki comes with a list container \footnote{Header: \url{https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/master/core/lib/list.h} Source: \url{https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/master/core/lib/list.c}}, however, when we were developing with their linked list we found that it was awkward to use in some situations (for instance creating an array of lists) so we decided that we needed to find a better list library. Our problem was that other container libraries were unlikely to be optimised to the low memory requirements or support the special compile chain used by Contiki. So rather than waste time searching and integrating an external library we decided to write our own set of containers. By doing the main benefit we gained was that we knew how the containers worked so had a better understanding how to use them.

Another reason to develop our own containers was that we desired an list where the data was stored in an array, this was for because it provides lower memory overhead and the types of operations we would be performing (append and empty) meant that an array backed list would be better. The lower memory overhead comes from the fact that an array-based list doesn't need to store a pointer to the next element as it is implicit (due to the contiguous memory) that a pointer to the current element's pointer plus one is the next element. This means that in a list of $N$ items our singly linked list implementation will require $(\text{sizeof}(T) + \text{sizeof}(void *) \times 2) \times N$ bytes of memory, whereas our array list implementation will require $(\text{sizeof}(T) + \text{sizeof}(void *)) \times N$ bytes of memory.

Our linked list implementation uses more memory compared to Contiki's implementation because their list is \emph{intrusive}\footnote{Boost Containers: \url{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1\_53\_0/doc/html/intrusive/presenting\_containers.html}}. What is meant by this is that the pointer to the next item in the list is contained in the structure stored in the list \cite{?}. Meaning their list uses the same amount of memory as our array list. However, because the list is intrusive it makes it more difficult to use as the implementation detail leaks into the structure using the library, this was why developing our own non-intrusive list made it easier to develop code.

We also developed containers that helped abstract certain concepts (such as list uniqueness or accessing elements by key) to decrease code duplication and allow us to express the code in a higher-level way making implementation easier. One thing to note is that for the containers we did not focus on implementing some of their functions to the standard complexity. For example our map implementation has requires O(N) for both insert and fetching, where these may be implemented as O(1) on average (hash tables) or O(log N) (trees), however due to the requirements of low memory we decided to keep using the array as the backing store for the data with the aim to keep memory for at the expense of non-optimal container management functions. The increased time complexity should make little difference as the containers tend to have few elements in them (i.e. hundreds rather than millions, where complexity would start to be important \cite{?}).

Finally, all of these custom containers are tested by a test suite that checks for functional correctness. Also the test suite was run using \verb|valgrind|\footnote{\url{http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html}} to check for memory leaks and corruption.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Multi-Packet}

In Contiki sending a single packet has its limits, there is only so much data you can get in a single packet. There are two C macros that are relevant to this \verb|PACKETBUF_HDR_SIZE| which is set to 48 bytes and \verb|PACKETBUF_SIZE| which is set to 128 bytes\footnote{packetbuf.h \url{http://contiki.sourceforge.net/docs/2.6/a00302.html}}. This means that in general we will only be able to send a packet containing 128 bytes of information, but what if we have a data structure that spans 300 bytes? Then we will need to have a way to send multiple packets and a receiver that can put the packets back together in the correct way to deliver the data.

Contiki's data transfer primitives for their RIME protocols are fairly hidden because of their focus on uIPv6. We found \verb|ruldolph0| first \footnote{ruldolph0 \url{http://contiki.sourceforge.net/docs/2.6/a01735.html}} and then \verb|rucb| (Reliable Unicast Bulk Transfer) much later \footnote{rucb \url{http://contiki.sourceforge.net/docs/2.6/a00365.html}}. However, both of them have problems, the API is very convoluted and seems more geared towards sending very large files across the network. This is very different to our aim, which is to send relatively small packets of data to a specific neighbour. So we wrote our own API that would split data of any given size and reassemble it once received, our API was not focused on processing data chunks like \verb|ruldolph0| or \verb|rucb|, but simply operated on a block of memory given to it. This is a case where a simpler API made development much easier for us. Admittedly because our implementation uses dynamic memory allocation it could potentially perform worse, but because the energy of sending and receiving messages dwarfs the energy usage of the CPU, we feel that easier development tradeoff it worth it. Also, now that code has been written to use this API, the \verb|multipacket| library itself could always be rewritten to use \verb|rucb| as a base to run more efficiently.


\subsubsection{N-Hop Flood}

\subsubsection{N-Hop Request}
Contiki provides broadcast primitives to allow the flooding of messages through the network, however the \verb|trickle|\cite{Levis04trickle} primitive only allows a single source node\footnote{trickle.h \url{http://contiki.sourceforge.net/docs/2.6/a00381.html}}, which presents a problem, when multiple nodes are attempting to send a message N-hops away. 
In some cases \verb|reliable unicast| could be used to target the specific nodes for which the message is intended. This, however, is not suitable when the identifies of the nodes is not known, or in situations when storing routing tables is not appropriate. 

Our response to this was to develop a primitive which would flood the network, a fixed number of hops from the source, whilst allowing multiple nodes to use the same primitive, with different messages. Our implementation uses a \verb|stubborn broadcast| to pass the message along a chain, only rebroadcasting the message when the hop limit (the number of hops the message is intended to travel) has not been reached. If a message has been seen before by a node (and the number of hops left is lower than before) it is simply ignored and not passed on. In the case where the hop count for a 
duplicate message is higher than the previously seen count, it is then rebroadcast, so that all the intended recipients will receive the message.  
After a fixed time, messages are then sent back to the source along a chain, this time is reset whenever a message with a higher hop count is seen.  Each node stores the ID of the node that it received the message from, and the response message is sent back to that node. In turn, that node will forward the message to the node it received the original message from, eventually the message will end up at the source, to be processed.

\subsubsection{Tree Aggregation}

As has been previously mentioned Tree Aggregation is a very useful technique employed in wireless sensor networks to aggregate a set of data to a single node in the network. It is very useful because of its ability to convey the same amount of data in potentially fewer messages. The algorithm works by first creating a tree structure such that nodes know of a parent node that they should unicast their messages to. Once this tree is set up the nodes (typically leaf nodes) unicast data to their parents, this can either happen when an event occurs or it can happen periodically. When a parent node receives a message it waits for a certain amount of time for more messages to arrive, every message it receives is stored and aggregated. After the time period is up the aggregated data is forwarded to its parent node. Once the data reaches the destination it is delivered to the user of the library.


The user of this library needs to implement four important functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\otimes_{agg}$] This function aggregates stored data with data message that has been received
\item[$\otimes_{own}$] This function aggregates the node's own data into the stored data
\item[$\otimes_{read}$] This function does the initial reading of data from a message and creates the local stored data
\item[$\otimes_{write}$] This function writes the local stored data back to a packet
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Neighbour Detect}

To aid in debugging a vital piece of information that will be required about the network is its topology. Trying to analyse network state without knowing which nodes are neighbours of other nodes, makes drawing meaningful conclusions from that data much harder. This meant that we needed a way to send neighbour information back to the sink. Thankfully part of the job is already accomplished as Contiki comes with a library to perform neighbour detection\cite{?}. We extended that library in two ways.

The first was to add more features to Contiki's neighbour detect library. As that library was very simple and supported only saying that a neighbour had been detected (with the option of providing a integer value as well). As we were aiming for this code to support changes in the network, such as nodes leaving or joining neighbourhoods, we added the concept of a round. Instead of just knowing about neighbours at that instant in time, it allowed the library to maintain some kind of history about what nodes were neighbours of other nodes in the past. Whenever new nodes are detected they are recorded, however, if a node has not been detected for a certain number of rounds then that node is removed from the record.

  \label{algo:neighbour-detect}
\end{figure}

For this to be useful we needed a way to get this data back to the sink node. There are many ways to do this, but one of the best is aggregating along a tree because it can combine many messages into a single one and forward that aggregated message instead of lots of smaller messages \cite{?}. The Neighbour Aggregation part uses the Tree Aggregation library that we have developed, the function that is used to aggregate data together is $\cup$ (union), this allows data to be aggregated with other data and allows that data to be updated. The nodes own data is set to be $\res{node-data}$, where $\var{j}$ is the current node's address and $\res{round-data}$ is the set of node addresses provided by the $\res{round-complete}$ callback in \autoref{algo:neighbour-detect}.

\begin{equation}
\res{node-data} = \{\{\var{other}, \var{j}\} | \var{other} \in \res{round-data} \}
\end{equation}

  \caption{Clustering Algorithm}
\end{figure}

In a wireless network, message collisions are a significant factor in terms of decreasing performance; collisions are more likely in environments featuring a high density of messages. The intuitive solution to this is to reduce the number of messages sent, with minimal compromise in the richness of the data communicated. To this end, we implemented a clustering algorithm. The principle of operation of a clustering algorithm is to establishe a set of clusterheads on network intitialisation. Each of the other nodes in the network allocates itself exactly one clusterhead, through which all traffic to the sink is routed.

In our implementation, the network initialisation phase occurs when an application running on the nodes begins; this application calls the cluster setup routine. The clusterheads are selected to be the set of nodes in the one-hop neighbourhood of the sink. These nodes broadcast their status as a clusterhead to the rest of the network, and the nodes decide with which clusterhead to align themselves based on shortest distance (in hops). Throughout the resmainder of the network's operation, each node passes its messages to the sink through its chosen clusterhead. At this point control is passed back to the application, which can then call the relevant functions to send a message from a node to the sink through that node's clusterhead. As the nature of the setup guarantees that clusterheads will be within one hop of the sink, the messages they pass on from their respective nodes are sent using Contiki's runicast message type. There are no such guarantees for the other nodes, so Contiki's mesh routing is used to allow for arbitrary distance between a node and its clusterhead. This approach to clustering works well when used in small networks, as it achieves its main goal of reducing the number of messages being passed (specifically, the medium will be a lot less congested in the one-hop neighbourhood of the sink). However, this algorithm clearly does not scale well with either geographical distance or number of nodes. In the former case, the majority of nodes will be out of direct transmission range of their clusterhead and will thus have to route messages through several other intermediary nodes; thus increasing the number of messages in the network. Similarly, with large networks a large number of nodes will all need to send messages to clusterheads which form an increasingly small proportion of the network; this is liable to cause bottlenecks and collisions.

\subsection{Hierarchical Clustering}

To counter the given disadvantages of our basic clustering implementation, we developed an additional algorithm which employs the concept of hierarchical clustering. That is, a cluster featuring multiple layers of clusters, each with  clusterhead that has a clusterhead of its own in the next layer. The setup phase of this algorithm also chooses the one-hop neighbourhood of the sink as clusterheads. However, when these clusterheads' setup messages are broadcast through the network, if a node detects that its nearest clusterhead is at least $d$ hops away –- where $d$ is defined as a constant in \verb|contiki.c| –- then that node elects itself as a clusterhead of a new layer, and generates its own setup message to be broadcast. We initially designed two versions of hierarchical clustering; one for arbitrary values of $d$, and one for $d=1$ (where every non-leaf node becomes a clusterhead). However, once the former version was finished we decided to consolidate both versions into one and simply treat $d=1$ as a specific case. To avoid the potential problem of mesh routing creating more messages than the hierarchical clustering saves, in cases of any node being within direct range of its clusterhead, it transmits using runicast. In all other cases, the node uses mesh as before. The hierarchical approach removes the major limitations of our initial clustering implementation, however it still suffers from selecting permanent clusterheads (whereas methods such as LEACH randomise the clusterheads periodically) and thus causing increased power usage for these nodes. Unfortunately, given that clustering is used as a library my some arbitrary application running on the nodes, the implementation of reassigning clusterheads (in any manner of synchronicity) proved infeasible.


\subsection{Predicate Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Began with single hop predicates
	\begin{itemize}
		\item used Mesh to gather information from surrounding nodes, due to implementation, we could only send one message as a one time
	\end{itemize}	
	\item[] Started work on Multi-hop local based predicates
	\begin{itemize}
		\item used N-Hop Req to send initial message down the chain
		\item We tried using trickle to return the results back to the originating node. However, due to trickles implementation, only one message could be flooded through the network at one time. 
		\item due to collisions, we used ctimers to delay the responses to messages sent back to the originator node.
		\item next step is to re-implement the algorithm, so that nodes send messages directly back along the chain of nodes they recieved the predicated check message from. This way the messages will be more reliably returned to the orignator node. This also allows for multiple messages to be sent this way.
		\item can't really do it via waiting for nodes to respond - difficult to know how long to wait
		\item[] If each node waits (e.g.) 10 seconds, then messages will be lost as they go backwards, as the originating node will have already sent its message back
	\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{TDMA}

To have a representative algorithm of what may be tested, TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) was chosen to be implemented and have predicates written for it. The algorithm that was initially implemented was described by \citeauthor{DCATechReport} in \cite[p.~4]{DCATechReport} and is outlined below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initially assign every node the smallest numbered channel
\item Every round every node broadcasts a message containing their ID and their currently assigned channel
\item When a message is received the neighbour set is updated and the node that received the message assigns its channel to be the lowest channel not assigned to any neighbour. Two neighbours are not allowed to change their channel in the same round, so a tie breaker is done and the node with the lower ID is allowed to change their channel
\item After choosing a channel the node broadcasts its ID and chosen channel
\item The procedure is repeated until every node cannot choose a smaller channel than its current channel
\end{enumerate}

Interestingly enough when this was first implemented the algorithm only made sure that a node did not have the same channel as any of its one hop neighbours. It did not ensure that the one hop neighbours of any node would have unique channels (as would be required by TDMA to ensure no collisions). This is the kind of bug that running predicates would have assisted identifying.

To make sure that the channel allocation was suitable for TDMA, instead of nodes just sending their own channel assignment to its neighbours. It also included the assignment of the one hop neighbours it knows about in that message. This then allowed nodes to receive information on their two hop neighbourhoods, which they then based their decision on what channel to allocate to themselves from.
