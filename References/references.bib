	into three categories based on the underlying network structure:
	flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these
	protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based,
	QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation.
	We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead
	savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages

	monitoring global system parameters in IP networks and sensor networks.
	A global system predicate is defined as a conjunction of the local
	properties of different network elements. A typical example is to
	identify the time windows when the outbound traffic from each network
	element exceeds a predefined threshold. Our main idea is to optimize
	the scheduling of local event reporting across network elements for
	a given network traffic load and local event frequencies. The system
	architecture consists of N distributed network elements coordinated
	by a central monitoring station. Each network element monitors a
	set of local properties and the central station is responsible for
	identifying the status of global parameters registered in the system.
	We design an optimal algorithm, the partition and rank (PAR) scheme,
	when the local events are independent; whereas, when they are dependent,
	we show that the problem is NP-complete and develop two efficient
	heuristics: the PAR for dependent events (PAR-D) and adaptive (Ada)
	algorithms, which adapt well to changing network conditions, and
	outperform the current state of the art techniques in terms of communication

	important role in future civilian and military settings. Collaborative
	microsensors could be very effective in monitoring their operations.
	However, low power and in-network data processing make data-centric
	routing in wireless sensor networks a challenging problem. In this
	paper we propose heuristics to construct and maintain an aggregation
	tree in sensor networks. This aggregation tree can be used to facilitate
	data-centric routing. The main idea is to turn off the radio of all
	leaf nodes to save power, and thereby extending the network lifetime.
	Therefore, in order to save the number of broadcasting messages,
	only the nonleaf nodes in the tree are in charge of data aggregation
	and traffic relaying. In this paper, we propose an efficient energy-aware
	distributed heuristic to generate the aggregation tree, which we
	refer to as EADAT. Our EADAT algorithm makes no assumption on local
	network topology, and is based on residual power. It makes use of
	neighboring broadcast scheduling and distributed competition among
	neighbors. These novel concepts make EADAT very efficient and effective,
	as demonstrated by our simulation experiments with NS2.},

	an interpreter for the language. To reduce program distribution energy
	the SCript interpreter stores a tokenized representation of the scripts
	which is distributed through the wireless network. The ROM and RAM
	footprint of the interpreter is similar to that of existing virtual

	This research focuses on dynamic techniques for discovering invariants
	from execution traces. This article reports three results. First,
	it describes techniques for dynamically discovering invariants, along
	with an implementation, named Daikon, that embodies these techniques.
	Second, it reports on the application of Daikon to two sets of target
	programs. In programs from Gries's work (1981) on program derivation,
	the system rediscovered predefined invariants. In a C program lacking
	explicit invariants, the system discovered invariants that assisted
	a software evolution task. These experiments demonstrate that, at
	least for small programs, invariant inference is both accurate and
	useful. Third, it analyzes scalability issues, such as invariant
	detection runtime and accuracy, as functions of test suites and program

  abstract = {This thesis focuses on three fundamental issues that concern data
	aggregation protocols for periodic data collection in sensor networks:
	which sensor nodes should report their data, when should they report
	it, and should they use unicast or broadcast based protocols for
	this purpose. The issue of when nodes should report their data is
	considered in the context of real-time monitoring applications. The
	first part of this thesis shows that asynchronous aggregation, in
	which the time of each node’s transmission is determined adaptively
	based on its local history of past packet receptions from its children,
	outperforms synchronous aggregation by providing lower delay for
	a given end-to-end loss rate. Second, new broadcast-based aggregation
	protocols that minimize the number of packet transmissions, relying
	on multipath delivery rather than automatic repeat request for reliability,
	are designed and evaluated. The performance of broadcast-based aggregation
	is compared to that of unicast-based aggregation, in the context
	of both real-time and delay-tolerant data collection. Finally, this
	thesis investigates the potential benefits of dynamically, rather
	than semi-statically, determining the set of nodes reporting their
	data, in the context of applications in which coverage of some monitored
	region is to be maintained. Unicast and broadcast-based coverage-preserving
	data aggregation protocols are designed and evaluated. The performance
	of the proposed protocols is compared to that of data collection
	protocols relying on node scheduling.},

  abstract = {This report introduces a new sensor network simulator for the Contiki
	OS - the COOJA Simulator. The Contiki OS is a portable operating
	system designed specifically for resource limited devices such as
	sensor nodes. It is built around an event-driven kernel but supports
	pre-emptive multithreading at a per-process basis. It also supports
	a full TCP/IP stack via uIP and the programming abstraction Protothreads.
	The main design goal of the COOJA Simulator is extendibility, for
	which Interfaces and Plugins are used. An Interface represents a
	sensor node property or device, such as a position, a button or a
	radio transmitter. A Plugin is used to interact with a simulation,
	for example to control the simulation speed or to watch all network
	traffic between the simulated nodes. Both new Plugins and Interfaces
	can easily be created and added to the simulation environment. A
	number of other parts of the simulator, for example a radio medium
	responsible for forwarding radio network data, can also be implemented
	and added to the simulator. And by supporting several different simulation
	environments at the same time in one simulation, different underlying
	hardware platforms can be simulated in heterogeneous networks. Java
	Native Interface is used to connect the new simulator with Contiki,
	allowing simulated applications to run in a real Contiki system.
	By using this approach, any simulated application can then be run
	on a real sensor node unaltered.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses detection of global predicates in a distributed
	program. Earlier algorithms for detection of global predicates proposed
	by Chandy and Lamport (1985) work only for stable predicates. A predicate
	is stable if it does not turn false once it becomes true. Our algorithms
	detect even unstable predicates, without excessive overhead. In the
	past, such predicates have been regarded as too difficult to detect.
	The predicates are specified by using a logic described formally
	in this paper. We discuss detection of weak conjunctive predicates
	that are formed by conjunction of predicates local to processes in
	the system. Our detection methods will detect whether such a predicate
	is true for any interleaving of events in the system, regardless
	of whether the predicate is stable. Also, any predicate that can
	be reduced to a set of weak conjunctive predicates is detectable.
	This class of predicates captures many global predicates that are
	of interest to a programmer. The message complexity of our algorithm
	is bounded by the number of messages used by the program. The main
	applications of our results are in debugging and testing of distributed
	programs. Our algorithms have been incorporated in a distributed
	debugger that runs on a network of Sun workstations in UNIX},

	By instrumenting a program and observing its behavior as it runs,
	DIDUCE dynamically formulates hypotheses of invariants obeyed by
	the program. DIDUCE hypothesizes the strictest invariants at the
	beginning, and gradually relaxes the hypothesis as violations are
	detected to allow for new behavior. The violations reported help
	users to catch software bugs as soon as they occur. They also give
	programmers new visibility into the behavior of the programs such
	as identifying rare corner cases in the program logic or even locating
	hidden errors that corrupt the program's results. We implemented
	the DIDUCE system for Java programs and applied it to four programs
	of significant size and complexity. DIDUCE succeeded in identifying
	the root causes of programming errors in each of the programs quickly
	and automatically. In particular, DIDUCE is effective in isolating
	a timing-dependent bug in a released JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension)
	library, which would have taken an experienced programmer days to
	find. Our experience suggests that detecting and checking program
	invariants dynamically is a simple and effective methodology for
	debugging many different kinds of program errors across a wide variety

	of communication in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where sensor
	nodes aggregate and relay data to a sink node. For WSN applications
	that require fast response time, it is imperative that the data reaches
	the sink as fast as possible. For such timeliness guarantees, TDMA-based
	scheduling can be used to assign time slots to nodes in which they
	can transmit messages. However, any slot assignment approach needs
	to be cognisant of the fact that crash failures can occur (e.g.,
	due to battery exhaustion, defective hardware). In this paper, we
	study the design of such data aggregation scheduling (converge cast)
	protocols. We make the following contributions: (i) we identify a
	necessary condition to solve the converge cast problem, (ii) we introduce
	two versions of the converge cast problem, namely (a) a strong version,
	and (b) a weak version , (iii) we show that the strong converge cast
	problem cannot be solved, (iv) we show that deterministic weak converge
	cast cannot be solved in presence of crash failures, (v) we show
	that there is no d-local algorithm that solves stabilising weak converge
	cast in presence of crash failures, (vi) we provide a modular d-local
	algorithm that solves stabilising weak converge cast in presence
	of crash failures where d is the network radius, and (vii) we show
	how specific instantiations of parameters can lead to an d-local
	algorithm that achieves more efficient stabilization. Our contributions
	are novel: (i) the first contribution (necessary condition) provides
	the theoretical basis which explains the structure of existing converge
	cast algorithms, and (ii) the study of converge cast in presence
	of crash failures has not previously been studied.},

	The original source location problem is to protect the location of

  abstract = {Reprogramming of sensor networks is an important and challenging problem
	as it is often necessary to reprogram the sensors in place. In this
	paper, we propose a multihop reprogramming service designed for Mica-2/XSM
	motes. One of the problems in reprogramming is the issue of message
	collision. To reduce the problem of collision and hidden terminal
	problem, we propose a sender selection algorithm that attempts to
	guarantee that in a neighborhood there is at most one source transmitting
	the program at a time. Further, our sender selection is greedy in
	that it tries to select the sender that is expected to have the most
	impact. We also use pipelining to enable fast data propagation. MNP
	is energy efficient because it reduces the active radio time of a
	sensor node by putting the node into "sleep" state when its neighbors
	are transmitting a segment that is not of interest. Finally, we argue
	that it is possible to tune our service according to the remaining
	battery level of a sensor, i.e., it can be tuned so that the probability
	that a sensor is given the responsibility of transmitting the code
	is proportional to its remaining battery life},

  abstract = {There has been a growing interest in applying formal methods for functional
	and performance verification of complex and safety critical designs.
	Model checking is one of the most common formal verification methodologies
	utilized in verifying sequential logic due to its automated decision
	procedures and its ability to provide ldquo;counter examples rdquo;
	for debugging. However, model checking hasn't found broad acceptance
	as a verification methodology due to its complexity. This arises
	because of the need to specify correctness properties in a temporal
	logic language and develop an environment around a partitioned model
	under test in a non deterministic HDL-type language. Generally, engineers
	are not trained in mathematical logic languages and becoming proficient
	in such a language requires a steep learning curve. Furthermore,
	defining a behavioral environment at the complex and undocumented
	microarchitectural interface level is a time consuming and error
	prone activity. As such, there is a strong motivation to bring the
	model checking technology to a level such that the designers may
	utilize this technology as a part of their design process without
	being burdened with the details that are generally only within the
	grasps of computer theoreticians. The paper outlines two tools which
	greatly assist in this goal: the first, Polly, automates the difficult
	and error prone task of developing the behavioral environment around
	the partitioned model under test; the second Oracle, obviates the
	need for learning temporal logic to enter specification},

  abstract = {Wireless platforms are becoming less expensive and more powerful,
	enabling the promise of widespread use for everything from health
	monitoring to military sensing. Like other networks, sensor networks
	are vulnerable to malicious attack. However, the hardware simplicity
	of these devices makes defense mechanisms designed for traditional
	networks infeasible. This paper explores the denial-of-sleep attack,
	in which a sensor node's power supply is targeted. Attacks of this
	type can reduce the sensor lifetime from years to days and have a
	devastating impact on a sensor network. This paper classifies sensor
	network denial-of-sleep attacks in terms of an attacker's knowledge
	of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol and ability to
	bypass authentication and encryption protocols. Attacks from each
	classification are then modeled to show the impacts on four sensor
	network MAC protocols, i.e., Sensor MAC (S-MAC), Timeout MAC (T-MAC),
	Berkeley MAC (B-MAC), and Gateway MAC (G-MAC). Implementations of
	selected attacks on S-MAC, T-MAC, and B-MAC are described and analyzed
	in detail to validate their effectiveness and analyze their efficiency.
	Our analysis shows that the most efficient attack on S-MAC can keep
	a cluster of nodes awake 100% of the time by an attacker that sleeps
	99% of the time. Attacks on T-MAC can keep victims awake 100% of
	the time while the attacker sleeps 92% of the time. A framework for
	preventing denial-of-sleep attacks in sensor networks is also introduced.
	With full protocol knowledge and an ability to penetrate link-layer

	caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand
	the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize
	four qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods.
	Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic
	rules for detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict
	normal sensor behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging
	anomalous sensor readings as faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods
	start with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement
	is compared against its predicted value computed using time series
	forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods
	infer a model for the normal sensor readings using training data,
	and then statistically detect and identify classes of faults. We
	find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on
	the accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly
	accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of
	parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome to train, but can
	accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate,
	but cannot classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are
	more effective for detecting short duration faults than long duration
	ones, and incur more false positives than the other methods. We apply
	these techniques to four real-world sensor datasets and find that
	the prevalence of faults as well as their type varies with datasets.
	All four methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor
	faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first
	step towards automated online fault detection and classification.},

	medium access control (MAC) schemes in ad hoc, wireless networks.
	However, CSMA and its current variants do not provide quality-of-service
	(QoS) guarantees for real-time traffic support. This paper presents
	and studies black-burst (BB) contention, which is a distributed MAC
	scheme that provides QoS real-time access to ad hoc CSMA wireless
	networks. With this scheme, real-time nodes contend for access to
	the channel with pulses of energy-so called BBs-the durations of
	which are a function of the delay incurred by the nodes until the
	channel became idle. It is shown that real-time packets are not subject
	to collisions and that they have access priority over data packets.
	When operated in an ad hoc wireless LAN, BB contention further guarantees
	bounded and typically very small real-time delays. The performance
	of the network can approach that attained under ideal time division
	multiplexing (TDM) via a distributed algorithm that groups real-time
	packet transmissions into chains. A general analysis of BB contention
	is given, contemplating several modes of operation. The analysis
	provides conditions for the scheme to be stable. Its results are
	complemented with simulations that evaluate the performance of an
	ad hoc wireless LAN with a mixed population of data and real-time

abstract={In today's competitive industry marketplace, the companies face growing demands to improve process efficiencies, comply with environmental regulations, and meet corporate financial objectives. Given the increasing age of many industrial systems and the dynamic industrial manufacturing market, intelligent and low-cost industrial automation systems are required to improve the productivity and efficiency of such systems. The collaborative nature of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) brings several advantages over traditional wired industrial monitoring and control systems, including self-organization, rapid deployment, flexibility, and inherent intelligent-processing capability. In this regard, IWSN plays a vital role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing industrial system that rapidly responds to real-time events with appropriate actions. In this paper, first, technical challenges and design principles are introduced in terms of hardware development, system architectures and protocols, and software development. Specifically, radio technologies, energy-harvesting techniques, and cross-layer design for IWSNs have been discussed. In addition, IWSN standards are presented for the system owners, who plan to utilize new IWSN technologies for industrial automation applications. In this paper, our aim is to provide a contemporary look at the current state of the art in IWSNs and discuss the still-open research issues in this field and, hence, to make the decision-making process more effective and direct.},
