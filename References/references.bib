  abstract = { Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation,
	and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management,
	and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed
	for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing
	protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network
	architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art
	routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges
	for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey
	of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified
	into three categories based on the underlying network structure:
	flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these
	protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based,
	QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation.
	We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead
	savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages
	and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes
	with possible future research areas.},

	A global system predicate is defined as a conjunction of the local

	element exceeds a predefined threshold. Our main idea is to optimize
	the scheduling of local event reporting across network elements for
	a given network traffic load and local event frequencies. The system
	architecture consists of N distributed network elements coordinated
	by a central monitoring station. Each network element monitors a
	set of local properties and the central station is responsible for
	identifying the status of global parameters registered in the system.
	We design an optimal algorithm, the partition and rank (PAR) scheme,
	when the local events are independent; whereas, when they are dependent,
	we show that the problem is NP-complete and develop two efficient
	heuristics: the PAR for dependent events (PAR-D) and adaptive (Ada)

  abstract = {Wireless platforms are becoming less expensive and more powerful,
	enabling the promise of widespread use for everything from health
	monitoring to military sensing. Like other networks, sensor networks
	are vulnerable to malicious attack. However, the hardware simplicity
	of these devices makes defense mechanisms designed for traditional
	networks infeasible. This paper explores the denial-of-sleep attack,
	in which a sensor node's power supply is targeted. Attacks of this
	type can reduce the sensor lifetime from years to days and have a
	devastating impact on a sensor network. This paper classifies sensor
	network denial-of-sleep attacks in terms of an attacker's knowledge
	of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol and ability to
	bypass authentication and encryption protocols. Attacks from each
	classification are then modeled to show the impacts on four sensor
	network MAC protocols, i.e., Sensor MAC (S-MAC), Timeout MAC (T-MAC),
	Berkeley MAC (B-MAC), and Gateway MAC (G-MAC). Implementations of
	selected attacks on S-MAC, T-MAC, and B-MAC are described and analyzed
	in detail to validate their effectiveness and analyze their efficiency.
	Our analysis shows that the most efficient attack on S-MAC can keep
	a cluster of nodes awake 100% of the time by an attacker that sleeps
	99% of the time. Attacks on T-MAC can keep victims awake 100% of
	the time while the attacker sleeps 92% of the time. A framework for
	preventing denial-of-sleep attacks in sensor networks is also introduced.
	With full protocol knowledge and an ability to penetrate link-layer
	encryption, all wireless sensor network MAC protocols are susceptible
	to a full domination attack, which reduces the network lifetime to
	the minimum possible by maximizing the power consumption of the nodes'
	radio subsystem. Even without the ability to penetrate encryption,
	subtle attacks can be launched, which reduce the network lifetime
	by orders of magnitude. If sensor networks are to meet current expectations,
	they mu- - st be robust in the face of network attacks to include
	denial-of-sleep.},

  abstract = {Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) is one of the most pervasive
	medium access control (MAC) schemes in ad hoc, wireless networks.
	However, CSMA and its current variants do not provide quality-of-service
	(QoS) guarantees for real-time traffic support. This paper presents
	and studies black-burst (BB) contention, which is a distributed MAC
	scheme that provides QoS real-time access to ad hoc CSMA wireless
	networks. With this scheme, real-time nodes contend for access to
	the channel with pulses of energy-so called BBs-the durations of
	which are a function of the delay incurred by the nodes until the
	channel became idle. It is shown that real-time packets are not subject
	to collisions and that they have access priority over data packets.
	When operated in an ad hoc wireless LAN, BB contention further guarantees
	bounded and typically very small real-time delays. The performance
	of the network can approach that attained under ideal time division
	multiplexing (TDM) via a distributed algorithm that groups real-time
	packet transmissions into chains. A general analysis of BB contention
	is given, contemplating several modes of operation. The analysis
	provides conditions for the scheme to be stable. Its results are
	complemented with simulations that evaluate the performance of an
