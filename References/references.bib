  abstract = {This report introduces a new sensor network simulator for the Contiki
	OS - the COOJA Simulator. The Contiki OS is a portable operating
	system designed specifically for resource limited devices such as
	sensor nodes. It is built around an event-driven kernel but supports
	pre-emptive multithreading at a per-process basis. It also supports
	a full TCP/IP stack via uIP and the programming abstraction Protothreads.
	The main design goal of the COOJA Simulator is extendibility, for
	which Interfaces and Plugins are used. An Interface represents a
	sensor node property or device, such as a position, a button or a
	radio transmitter. A Plugin is used to interact with a simulation,
	for example to control the simulation speed or to watch all network
	traffic between the simulated nodes. Both new Plugins and Interfaces
	can easily be created and added to the simulation environment. A
	number of other parts of the simulator, for example a radio medium
	responsible for forwarding radio network data, can also be implemented
	and added to the simulator. And by supporting several different simulation
	environments at the same time in one simulation, different underlying
	hardware platforms can be simulated in heterogeneous networks. Java
	Native Interface is used to connect the new simulator with Contiki,
	allowing simulated applications to run in a real Contiki system.
	By using this approach, any simulated application can then be run
	on a real sensor node unaltered.},

	nodes aggregate and relay data to a sink node. For WSN applications
	that require fast response time, it is imperative that the data reaches
	the sink as fast as possible. For such timeliness guarantees, TDMA-based
	scheduling can be used to assign time slots to nodes in which they
	can transmit messages. However, any slot assignment approach needs
	to be cognisant of the fact that crash failures can occur (e.g.,
	due to battery exhaustion, defective hardware). In this paper, we
	study the design of such data aggregation scheduling (converge cast)
	protocols. We make the following contributions: (i) we identify a
	necessary condition to solve the converge cast problem, (ii) we introduce
	two versions of the converge cast problem, namely (a) a strong version,
	and (b) a weak version , (iii) we show that the strong converge cast
	problem cannot be solved, (iv) we show that deterministic weak converge
	cast cannot be solved in presence of crash failures, (v) we show
	that there is no d-local algorithm that solves stabilising weak converge
	cast in presence of crash failures, (vi) we provide a modular d-local
	algorithm that solves stabilising weak converge cast in presence
	of crash failures where d is the network radius, and (vii) we show
	how specific instantiations of parameters can lead to an d-local
	algorithm that achieves more efficient stabilization. Our contributions
	are novel: (i) the first contribution (necessary condition) provides
	the theoretical basis which explains the structure of existing converge
	cast algorithms, and (ii) the study of converge cast in presence
	of crash failures has not previously been studied.},

  abstract = {There has been a growing interest in applying formal methods for functional
	and performance verification of complex and safety critical designs.
	Model checking is one of the most common formal verification methodologies
	utilized in verifying sequential logic due to its automated decision
	procedures and its ability to provide ldquo;counter examples rdquo;
	for debugging. However, model checking hasn't found broad acceptance
	as a verification methodology due to its complexity. This arises
	because of the need to specify correctness properties in a temporal
	logic language and develop an environment around a partitioned model
	under test in a non deterministic HDL-type language. Generally, engineers
	are not trained in mathematical logic languages and becoming proficient
	in such a language requires a steep learning curve. Furthermore,
	defining a behavioral environment at the complex and undocumented
	microarchitectural interface level is a time consuming and error
	prone activity. As such, there is a strong motivation to bring the
	model checking technology to a level such that the designers may
	utilize this technology as a part of their design process without
	being burdened with the details that are generally only within the
	grasps of computer theoreticians. The paper outlines two tools which
	greatly assist in this goal: the first, Polly, automates the difficult
	and error prone task of developing the behavioral environment around
	the partitioned model under test; the second Oracle, obviates the
	need for learning temporal logic to enter specification},

  abstract = {Wireless platforms are becoming less expensive and more powerful,
	enabling the promise of widespread use for everything from health
	monitoring to military sensing. Like other networks, sensor networks
	are vulnerable to malicious attack. However, the hardware simplicity
	of these devices makes defense mechanisms designed for traditional
	networks infeasible. This paper explores the denial-of-sleep attack,
	in which a sensor node's power supply is targeted. Attacks of this
	type can reduce the sensor lifetime from years to days and have a
	devastating impact on a sensor network. This paper classifies sensor
	network denial-of-sleep attacks in terms of an attacker's knowledge
	of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol and ability to
	bypass authentication and encryption protocols. Attacks from each
	classification are then modeled to show the impacts on four sensor
	network MAC protocols, i.e., Sensor MAC (S-MAC), Timeout MAC (T-MAC),
	Berkeley MAC (B-MAC), and Gateway MAC (G-MAC). Implementations of
	selected attacks on S-MAC, T-MAC, and B-MAC are described and analyzed
	in detail to validate their effectiveness and analyze their efficiency.
	Our analysis shows that the most efficient attack on S-MAC can keep
	a cluster of nodes awake 100% of the time by an attacker that sleeps
	99% of the time. Attacks on T-MAC can keep victims awake 100% of
	the time while the attacker sleeps 92% of the time. A framework for
	preventing denial-of-sleep attacks in sensor networks is also introduced.
	With full protocol knowledge and an ability to penetrate link-layer
	encryption, all wireless sensor network MAC protocols are susceptible
	to a full domination attack, which reduces the network lifetime to
	the minimum possible by maximizing the power consumption of the nodes'
	radio subsystem. Even without the ability to penetrate encryption,
	subtle attacks can be launched, which reduce the network lifetime
	by orders of magnitude. If sensor networks are to meet current expectations,
	they mu- - st be robust in the face of network attacks to include
	denial-of-sleep.},

	medium access control (MAC) schemes in ad hoc, wireless networks.
	However, CSMA and its current variants do not provide quality-of-service
	(QoS) guarantees for real-time traffic support. This paper presents
	and studies black-burst (BB) contention, which is a distributed MAC
	scheme that provides QoS real-time access to ad hoc CSMA wireless
	networks. With this scheme, real-time nodes contend for access to
	the channel with pulses of energy-so called BBs-the durations of
	which are a function of the delay incurred by the nodes until the
	channel became idle. It is shown that real-time packets are not subject
	to collisions and that they have access priority over data packets.
	When operated in an ad hoc wireless LAN, BB contention further guarantees
	bounded and typically very small real-time delays. The performance
	of the network can approach that attained under ideal time division
	multiplexing (TDM) via a distributed algorithm that groups real-time
	packet transmissions into chains. A general analysis of BB contention
	is given, contemplating several modes of operation. The analysis
	provides conditions for the scheme to be stable. Its results are
	complemented with simulations that evaluate the performance of an
	ad hoc wireless LAN with a mixed population of data and real-time

	Medium access control (MAC) protocols take charge of the distribution

	loads directly, but the amount of traffic affects the efficiency

	in network with the average increase rate of data packets in a node's
